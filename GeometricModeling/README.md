# Geometric Modeling
Create an animated scene of Bézier curves.
![](../Gifs/project(6).gif)

## Instruction
1. Create a scene of at least five 3D Bézier curves.
1. How you color the scene is up to you.
1. How you animate the scene is up to you.
1. How many points you use to draw each curve is up to you (i.e., the Δt). But, use enough points in the GL_LINE_STRIP to make the curves look smooth.
1. Animate each curve by changing the position of one (or more) points per curve based on the Time variable.
1. Be able to turn the control points on and off.
1. Be able to turn the control lines on and off. (A "control line" is a line strip connecting the curve's first endpoint point to the control points in order, to the last endpoint.)
